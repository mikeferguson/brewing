# Pink Elephant (#4)

A Delirium Tremens clone.
Recipe from [homebrewtalk](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/pink-elephant-delirium-tremens-clone.112957/).
Brewed on TBD. This adds a few new elements to my brewing: lagering and
a yeast starter. 
Need to lager for 14 days, which means freeing up enough space in the fridge.
