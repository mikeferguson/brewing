# Pink Elephant (#4)

A Delirium Tremens clone.
Recipe from [homebrewtalk](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/pink-elephant-delirium-tremens-clone.112957/).
Brewed on November 28, 2020. Need to lager for 14 days, which means freeing
up enough space in the fridge.

Key Metrics:

 * OG: 1.067 (Target: 1.072)
 * FG: 1.006 (Target: 1.006)
 * IBUs: 22
 * ABV: 7.97%

Ingredients:

 * 8 lbs Belgian Pilsner
 * 1 lbs Belgian Candi Sugar (added in the last 10 minutes of the boil)
 * 0.75 oz Styrian Golding (60 minutes)
 * 0.5 oz Saaz (15 minutes)
 * Coriander Seed 7.2g, 10 minutes
 * Ginger 2.4g, 10 minutes
 * Grains of Paradise, 2.4g, 10 minutes
 * Wyeast 1388 (64-80F) (local shop doesn't have WLP570) in 1L start
   * Pretty sure I actually got sent 1318 - because I remember reading "London Ale III"
 * S-04 added when fermentation is 50-75% done. (or maybe skip this)

Brew Day:

 * Water:
   * 3.5 gallons of RO water
   * 1 gallon of RO water for sparge
   * 0.5g Gypsum
   * 1.0g CaCL
 * Mash (Anvil Foundry)
   * 10 min @ 125F
   * 45 min @ 144F
   * 30 min @ 158F
   * 5 min @ 172F mashout
   * Final pH: TBD
   * Gravity (per refractometer): 1.040 without sugar and before boil
 * Boil
   * 13L of water at start
   * Set to 212F at 6:55PM
   * Removed lid at 200F, 7:03PM
   * Boil began at 7:10PM
   * Boil ended at 8:40PM
 * Chill
   * Used whirlpool arm at full pump speed (no clamp)
   * Chilled to 80F
 * Cleanup done at 9:30PM

Fermentation:

 * 7 days primary fermentation at target 75-80F.
   * Stalled a few times, had to shake it up a bit.
   * Manually controlled the temperature.
 * 14 days at 32F lagering (in the fridge).
 * 21 days at 76F bottle condition.
 * Peak taste is at 2-3 months after bottling?

Notes:

 * I put the candi sugar in late - forgot it
 * 90 Minute boil is "Pilsner malt, drive off the DMS"
 * Batch cost: $52.27
   * Malt: 30.31
   * Hops: 4.48
   * Yeast: 12.98
   * Spices: 4.50
 * Came up short on water (only 2 gallons in fermenter, plus 0.25 gallons left in Foundry).
   I added 4.75 gallons total, so either more boiled off or we left a bunch in the grain?
   * Into fermenter: 2.5 gallons
   * Left in kettle: 0.25 gallons
   * Boiled off: 0.75 gallons (90 minute boil)
   * Left in grain: 1 gallon
 * Extract Efficiency:
   * PPG = 3 gal * 40 / 8 lbs = 15
   * Efficiency = 15 / 37 = 40.5%
