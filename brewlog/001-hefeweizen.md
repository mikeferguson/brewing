Notes:

 * Only yielded 2.25 gallons of wort in fermenter.
 * OG target was 1.049 - came up short at 1.042 (60% brewhouse efficiency). Possible culprits:
    * not sparging
    * running the pump to fast, causing tunneling
    * pH too high
 * Water supplements are estimated - my scale only has a resolution of 1 gram. Need to
   get a better one.
 * Batch cost: $18.73 ($11.10 malt, $1.40 hops, $4.99 yeast)

Things to Try Next Time:

 * Sparge method to get better efficiency.
