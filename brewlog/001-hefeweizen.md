Fermentation:

 * TBD

Notes:

 * Only yielded 2.25 gallons of wort in fermenter.
 * OG target was 1.049 - came up short at 1.042. In retrospect, this is almost certainly
   due to lower efficiencies from not sparging.
 * Water supplements are estimated - my scale only has a resolution of 1 gram. Need to
   get a better one.

Things to Try Next Time:

 * Sparge method to get better efficiency.
