# Funky Buddha Floridian Hefeweizen (#3)

From [Craft Beer and Brewing](https://beerandbrewing.com/funky-buddhas-floridian-hefeweizen-recipe/).
I've had the actual Floridian Hefeweizen, interested to see how similar this is.
One note was that "for more banana flavor, ferment at the warmer end of the yeast range".
