# Funky Buddha Floridian Hefeweizen (#5)

From [Craft Beer and Brewing](https://beerandbrewing.com/funky-buddhas-floridian-hefeweizen-recipe/).
Second try at this, trying to finish a little less dry.
One note was that "for more banana flavor, ferment at the warmer end of the yeast range".
Brewed on December 20, 2020.

Key Metrics:

 * OG: 1.047 (Target: 1.052)
 * FG: 1.004 (Target: 1.012)
 * IBUs: 12
 * ABV: 5.64% (Target: 5.2%)

Ingredients (for 3 gallons in fermenter at 65% efficiency):

 * 3.25 lbs Pilsner malt
 * 3.25 lbs Wheat malt
 * 0.175 oz (5g) Nugget hops (12.60%) at 60 minutes.
 * Wyeast 3068 (64-75F)

Brew Day:

 * Water
   * 3.5 gallons of RO water
   * 1.0 gallon of RO water for sparge
   * Approximately 2 grams Gypsum
   * Approximately 2 grams CaCl
   * Water treatment added to all water (4.5 gallons) and mixed thoroughly
   * PH before Mash In: ~6.25
 * Mash (Anvil Foundry)
   * Set to 155F
   * Mash in 154F at 2:05PM
   * No pump, just lots of stirring.
   * Used external thermometer to measure mash center - was about 146F, bumped foundry up to 158F at 2:30PM
   * 154 F for 60 minutes.
 * Lauter
   * Added 1 gallon of 152F water to sparge. Did a bit of manual recirculation.
   * Collected 4.1 gallons of wort at 1.037
   * Final pH: ~5.5
 * Boil
   * Set to boil at 3:20PM
   * Boil began at 3:50PM
   * Boil ended at 5:15PM (let it go a little long to boil off a bit of excess water - finished at about 3gal)
   * Gravity (per refractometer): 1.047
 * Chill
   * Used whirlpool arm at full pump speed (no clamp)

Fermentation:

 * Pitched full package of Wyeast 3068.
 * Fermented at 72F for 12 days, using heating belt and Anvil temperature controller.
 * Finished at 1.004
 * Bottled 64oz in uKeg and 16 bottles on 1/1/2021.

Notes:

 * First time using grain mill. Gap set to "Target Card" (0.033")
 * First time using a bag inside the mash tube. Way cleaner wort.
 * First time heating the sparge water to 152F.
 * First time using temperature control on the fermentation.
 * Too much water this time (somehow calculated on 1gal/hr boil, but it's only half that at 110V).
   Grains also only absorbed about half a gallon (0.75gal/lb)?
 * 2.5 gallons in the fermenter, about 0.5 gallons left in the Foundry.
 * Batch cost: $22.46 ($12.48 malt, $1.99 hops, $7.99 yeast)
 * Extract Efficiency:
   * PPG = 4.1 gal * 37 / 6.5 = 23.3
   * Efficiency = 23.3 / 38 = 61.3%
