# Hops Usage

 * [Troegs Hop Sniffing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYYC5wd-hIU)
   * 3 Hops in a balanced beer
     * Base - rich full on flavor (Galaxy, Citra)
     * Medium / Midtones - fills in missing pieces of base. (Mosaic, Nelson)
     * Top - hint of X. (BRU-1)
   * Mosaic and Citra is a home run - add another hop
   * "if a hop smells like mint, we throw it out"
