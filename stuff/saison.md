# Saisons

I really like the "Saison Manifesto" from the Maltose Falcons: a saison should be dry, earthy, spicy,
lively (highly carbonated, maybe a touch of sour), and yeast driven. The proper yeast can do all of
these, or you can "cheat" with some spices...

 * OG: 1.048 - 1.065 [BCJP], 1.045-1.056 [Markowski]
 * FG: 1.002 - 1.008 [BJCP], 1.002-1.010 [Markowski]
 * IBU: 20-35 [BJCP], 18-32 [Markowski]
 * SRM: 5-15 (pale), 15-22 (dark) [BJCP]
   * Markowski notes that Saisons were typically brewed with the the lightest colored malts. Today
     That would yield an SRM of 6 to 8. Historically, 10-14 would be more typical. His overall range
     is 3-18 SRM.
 * Ingredients
   * Water
     * Wellonian farmhouse wells tend to be high in temporary hardness (bicarbonate). [Markowski, 2004]
     * Adding calcium sulfate will help with dry finish. Above 100ppm sulfates will enhance flavor.
       Do not exceed 300ppm [Markowski, 2004]
   * Malt
     * Typically made of mainly Pilsner malt. Saison Dupont is 100% Pilsner malt. [Markwoski, 2004]
     * Some modern saisons add Vienna or Munich malt to get the dark 10-14 SRM color. [Markowski, 2004]
     * Oats, rye, etc were not uncommon, due to both ease of access on the farm, and lower tax rates in
       historical times. [Markowski, 2004]
   * Hops
     * Bittering Addition (60 minutes)
       * Usually East Kent Goldings or Styrian Goldings.
     * Flavor Addition (10-15 minutes)
       * Spiced saisons tend to go lighter on the flavor hops.
       * 0.1-0.12 ounces per gallon for moderate to high flavor. [Markowski, 2004]
       * Often Styrian Goldings, Saaz, or Hallertauer.
       * Saison Dupont skips this - just adds a massive Aroma charge. [Markowski, 2004]
     * Aroma Addition (1 minute)
       * 0.2-0.25 ounces per gallon. [Markowski, 2004]
       * Often Styrian Goldings, East Kent Goldings, or Saaz.
   * Yeast
     * Wyeast 3724 Belgian Saison (70-95F), 12% ABV Tolerance
       * Known to get stuck at 1.035 - temperature or second strain can help
       * 76-80% Attenuation
       * Markowski says 80-95F for temperature range
       * At temperatures near 70F, this yeast produces spicy notes, bubblegum aromatics, dry, crips and
         mildly acidic flavors. Increasing to 80-90F gives increased phenolics, fruity esters, earthy notes,
         and a "funky mustiness". [Craft Beer and Brewing](https://beerandbrewing.com/homebrew-fundamentals-for-saisons-and-bieres-de-garde/)
       * Possibly backpressure sensitive. [Maltese Falcons]
     * Wyeast 3711 French Saison (65-77F), 12% ABV Tolerance
       * Citrus, Grapefruit.
       * 77-83% Attentuation
       * Best known for ultra-attenuation even in the 70-75F range. [Craft Beer and Brewing](https://beerandbrewing.com/homebrew-fundamentals-for-saisons-and-bieres-de-garde/)
     * Wyeast 3726 Farmhouse Ale (70-84F), 12% ABV Tolerance
       * "Slightly tart and dry with a peppery finish"
       * 74-79% Attenuation
       * Heavy floculator
       * Craft Beer & Brewing notes it is more of a Biere de Garde yeast.
     * WLP565
     * Possible to add a wine yeast to finish cleaning up
       * Lalvin 71B
     * With most Saison yeasts, you want to start cool (65F) and let it ramp up.
   * Spices

   * Some folks add sugar to increase alcohol content - but that seems wrong
 * Mashing
   * Mash to maximize fermentable sugars for that dry finish.
   * If doing a single step mash, stay lower (143-147F), for a more fermentable wort. [Markwoski, 2004]
   * Saison Dupont uses a single infusion mash that ramps from 113 to 162F over 108 minutes. [Markowski, 2004]
 * Fermentation
   * Some say to start at 67F and let free rise,
   * Others say that high temps up front are really important (80F steady!)
