# Rules of Thumb

 * Mash Temperature
   * Lower temperature favors simple sugar production (higher ABV, thinner body, drier beer)
   * Higher temperature favors dextrins which are unfermentable
 * Water Chemistry
   * Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) adds alkalinity which makes hops astringent
   * Calcium Sulphate (CaSO4, also known as gypsum) accenuates hops without astringency,
     increases enzyme activity, and encourages yeast to settle.
   * Roasted malts are slightly acidic
