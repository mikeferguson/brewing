# Anvil Foundry 6.5G

 * [Anvil 6.5 Gallon Foundry](https://www.anvilbrewing.com/-p/anv-foundry-6.5.htm)
   * Wattage on 120v = 1600W
   * Wattage on 240v = 2800W
   * Tank diameter = 12.5 inches
   * Total height = 24.5 inches

## Statistics

 * Grain retains about 0.5 quarts water per pound of grain.
 * Transfer to fermenter leaves about 0.25 gallons in kettle.
 * Boils off 1 gal / hour at 120v.
 * Efficiency is terrible (even when sparging):
   * Batch 2: 4.75 pounds of grain in 3.8 gallons water: 23.57 PPG = 62% Eff. (2.4 qt/lb)
   * Batch 3: 6.5 pounds of grain in 4 gallons water: 18.6 PPG = 49% Eff. (1.85 qt/lb)
   * Batch 4: 8 pounds of grain in 4.75 gallons water: 18.8 PPG = 50% Eff. (1.75 qt/lb)
   * Thoughts: Grain Crush is the problem?

## Mashing

 * Without a bag, recommended crush is moderate 0.036"-0.040".
 * With a bag,
   [recommended crush](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/anvil-foundry-mash-eff.672843/post-8807712)
   is finer 0.028"-0.032". (Don't recirculate for the first 30 minutes).
 * Recirculation pump should be slow - 1/3 to 1/2 of full flow.

## Dupont Mash Test

On 12/1/2020 with 3.5 gallons of water. Targeting rough 0.5F rise per minute
for 113F to 162F over 108 minutes.

 * Start at 113F.
 * Set to 50% power, lid off
 * Rise to 119F in 9 minutes (should have taken 13 minutes)
 * Set to 45% power, lid off
 * Rise to 125F in 24 minutes (target: 27 minutes)
 * Rise to 131F in 37 minutes (target: 41 minutes)
 * Set to 45% power, with lid on
 * Rise to 137F in 50 minutes (target: 54 minutes)
 * Rise to 150F in 82 minutes (target: 81 minutes)
 * Rise to 162F in 115 minutes (target: 108 minutes)

## Recipe Checklist
 * Water sizing:
   * Left in kettle: 0.25 gallons.
   * Boil off: 0.5 gal / hour at 120v.
   * Left in grain: 1 quart / pound of grain.
