# Yeast Notes

Equipment progression

 * Starters
   * Flask
   * Orbital Shaker Table (DIY)
 * Harvesting
   * Mason Jars for short erm storage
   * Need larger glass container to separate out before putting in mason jars
   * Get about 4 mason jars from a single yeast cake
   	 * If re-using within 2-3 weeks, simply pitch one of the jars directly (maybe 5-6 weeks?)
   	 * Longer duration: make a starter
 * Long Term Storage
   * Petri dishes, Agar Mix (to streak and grow yeast colonies)
   * Slants, Agar Mix (to preserve yeast colonies)
   	 * 16x135mm
   * Loop (nichrome)
   * Burner
   * Pressure cooker
   * Incubator (70-80F)
   * Pharmacutical Mineral Oil for topping off slants?
 * Starter Progression From Slant
   * 1) More tubes (same as slants), but with autoclaved wort
   * 2) Mason jar of autoclaved wort
   * 3) 400ml starter in 500ml flask
   * 4) 1600ml starter in 2l flask?
 * Microscope - 40x objective with 10-15-20x eyepiece for 400-600-800X
   * to get 1000X magnification need 100X immersion oil objective
   * get 40-2000x? [How to build a yeast ranch](https://bkyeast.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/how-to-build-a-yeast-ranch/)
   * Slides + Cover glass
   * Sterile transfer pipettes
   * Hemocytometer
   *

## Propagation

 * Yeast Starter
   * Wyeast smack-pack contains 100B cells, yielding 10.5 million per mL in 2.5G batch
   * 
 * Harvest and Wash
  * After draining wort from fermenter, add water to rehydrate yeast cake.
  * Let rehydrated yeast stand 
  * 

 * Slanting Yeast

	just sealed with tape = 3 months viability
	sealed with water fill = 1 year viability
	sealed with mineral oil fill = 3 year viability
Yeast bank = 2 tubes per strain or culture

## Yeast Strains

### Hefeweizen Yeasts

 * SafAle WB-06 (Dry)
   * 64-75F, 10% ABV
 * Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan
   * 64-75F, higher temperatures yield more banana flavor

### NEIPA Yeasts

 * Lallemand New England American East Coast Ale Yeast is a dry version of "Conan"
 * Lallemand Verdant - slightly more body than typical, aroma and flavor of tropical fruit and apricot.
   * 64-73F, 10% ABV max
   * pitch at 18C, hold at 19C, with 10 points to go raise to 22C, drop to 15C for dry hopping?

### Kveik

 * [Low gravity worts require nutrient additions](https://www.escarpmentlabs.com/single-post/2019/11/01/The-impact-of-pitch-rate-on-kveik-ferments).
 * Optimal pitch rate is likely around [7 million cells / mL, but varies by strain](https://www.escarpmentlabs.com/single-post/2019/11/01/The-impact-of-pitch-rate-on-kveik-ferments).
 * [Can lead to a lower pH](https://www.escarpmentlabs.com/single-post/2019/10/20/Crispy-brewing-with-kveik).
 * Omega Lutra is fairly clean, can be used for "pseudo lagers"

### Belgian Yeasts

 * Wyeast 1388 Belgian Strong Ale
   * 64-80F, 12% ABV
   * Prone to stalling at 1.035, racking or aeration can help
