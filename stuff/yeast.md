## Hefeweizen Yeasts

 * SafAle WB-06 (Dry)
   * 64-75F, 10% ABV
 * Wyeast 3068 Weihenstephan
   * 64-75F, higher temperatures yield more banana flavor

   * pitch at 18C, hold at 19C, with 10 points to go raise to 22C, drop to 15C for dry hopping?

## Kveik

 * [Low gravity worts require nutrient additions](https://www.escarpmentlabs.com/single-post/2019/11/01/The-impact-of-pitch-rate-on-kveik-ferments).
 * Optimal pitch rate is likely around [7 million cells / mL, but varies by strain](https://www.escarpmentlabs.com/single-post/2019/11/01/The-impact-of-pitch-rate-on-kveik-ferments).
 * [Can lead to a lower pH](https://www.escarpmentlabs.com/single-post/2019/10/20/Crispy-brewing-with-kveik).
 * Omega Lutra is fairly clean, can be used for "pseudo lagers"

## Belgian Yeasts

 * Wyeast 1388 Belgian Strong Ale
   * 64-80F, 12% ABV
   * Prone to stalling at 1.035, racking or aeration can help
